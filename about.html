                <p>We are a group of students at Hampton University that have been tasked with making a website for our Database Management course.</p>
                <p>Our choice for the subject of our website was a site where you can buy all things related to laptops. This includes the laptops, peripherals, and accessories.</p>
                <p>We hope you enjoy our website and all it has to offer!</p>
                <p>Names: Brian Csehoski, Madison Boyd, AJ, Jania Southall, Elali McNair, Tamea Sayles</p>
